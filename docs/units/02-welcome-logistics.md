## Facilitator Script

> "Welcome to the MCP Compositional Architecture workshop!
>
> Today we'll learn why the most common MCP implementation pattern -- wrapping APIs as tools -- creates more problems than it solves, and how compositional skill design transforms MCP from a technical curiosity into a production-grade system.
>
> Before we dive in, let's do a quick check."

## Quick Account Check (5 min)

<div class="facilitator-only" markdown="1">

**Ask the room:**

1. "Raise your hand if you have Workato Developer Edition access?"
   - *If <80%: Pause and troubleshoot*

2. "Raise your hand if you have Salesforce Developer Edition access?"
   - *If <80%: Pause and troubleshoot*

3. "Any issues we need to address before we continue?"
   - *Note: Have backup accounts ready for emergencies*

## What You'll Leave With (5 min)

**Meet your troubleshooting buddy:**

Turn to the person next to you and introduce yourself. Name, what you do, and one thing you're hoping to learn today.

<div class="facilitator-only" markdown="1">

> *Give 60 seconds for introductions*
>
> "Congratulations -- you've just met your new best friend for the next two hours. When something breaks, they're your first call."

</div>

**Four takeaways from today:**

### 1. A Working Sandbox Environment
Your Workato and Salesforce sandboxes are yours to keep. Continue experimenting after today.

### 2. A Mental Model for Separation of Concerns
You'll understand what complexity belongs with the LLM and what belongs in the backend -- and why forcing LLMs to handle the wrong type of complexity is the root of most MCP headaches.

### 3. Hands-On Composition Experience
You'll build atomic skills and compose them into orchestrators. Real code, not just theory.

### 4. Pattern Recognition Skills
You'll recognize good and bad MCP tool design when you see it.

## Ground Rules (3 min)

1. **Ask questions anytime** - Raise hand or type in chat (hybrid)
2. **Help your best friend** - If you finish early, check in on your buddy
3. **It's okay to fall behind** - Materials are self-paced friendly
4. **Breaks are real breaks** - Step away, refresh, come back ready

---

## Logistics Reminders (2 min)

- **Wifi:** [network name] / [password]
- **Restrooms:** [location]
- **Breaks:** 15 min after demo, 15 min after Unit 1
- **Lunch:** [if applicable]

## Transition to Core Concepts

<div class="facilitator-only" markdown="1">

> "Great! Let's dive into why we're here. The Model Context Protocol has arrived as a standard for connecting AI agents to tools. But there's a critical gap between what the protocol provides and what production systems actually need. Let me show you what I mean..."
