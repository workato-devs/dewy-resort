### Timing Notes

- **Unit 0** often runs 5-10 minutes over due to account setup issues. Build buffer into Break 1 if needed.
- **Unit 3** can be shortened to design-only (skip implementation) if time is tight.
- If ahead of schedule, allow more time for Unit 2 bonus activities or Unit 3 implementation.
